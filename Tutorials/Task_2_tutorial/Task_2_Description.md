# Task II: Financial Search Agent Accuracy & Reliability

**Description**
This task challenges participants to develop "Agentic" financial search engines that minimize hallucinations and maximize numerical and temporal accuracy. The evaluation is split into two rigorous sub-challenges:

**1. Hallucination & Misinformation (35 Questions)**
Focuses on the agent's ability to provide factually correct information across 6 specific dimensions validated against **Yahoo Finance**:
*   Real-time market data
*   Basic Facts of Stocks
*   Trading-related Calculations
*   Company Fundamentals
*   Cross-Asset Comparison
*   News, Events & Disclosures

**2. Numerical & Temporal Accuracy (24 Questions)**
Evaluates precision in handling time-sensitive data, benchmarked against **FinSearchComp** standards. This includes three difficulty levels:
*   **Real-time retrieval**: 8 questions on live data accuracy.
*   **Historical data lookup**: 8 questions on retrieving past data points.
*   **Complex computations**: 8 questions requiring multi-step math on historical data.
